								Made during BEST Lviv Hackathon 2017 24-hour event (got 1st place).
							    The idea of the hackathon was to suggest user how to spend their money.
							    We made an extention for "Airbnb" (or "Couchsurfing") 
							    which would offer user an ability to spend their time with local people, 
							    who will make some paid tours for them.
